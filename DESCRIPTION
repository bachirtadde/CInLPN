Description: Contains functions to fit model for latent processes trajectories and 
             their temporal influences. The methodology is based on the combinaison of  
             linear mixed model for trajectories and system of 
             differences equations for the temporal influences. 
             The estimation is made within the maximum likelihood framework.
