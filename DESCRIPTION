Description: Contains functions to fit a dynamic model for multiple latent processes and estimate 
             their temporal influences. The methodology is based on the combinaison of  
             linear mixed model for latent processes trajectories and a system of 
             differences equations for assessing their temporal influences. 
             The estimation is done in the maximum likelihood framework.
